# Bamazon

## Overview

* I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and node. 

* The bamazonCustomer.js file will take in orders from customers from a pre-set list of products and deplete stock from the store's inventory once a product is purchased.  

* The bamazonManager.js file allows you to View Products for Sale, View Low Inventory, Add to Inventory, and Add New Product.  

    * The Manager file will then prompt you with a series of guides, allowing you to make specifications for your actions.

## Set Up

* Be sure to connect your localhost to port 8889
* Copy and paste the contents of bamazon.sql into MySQLWorkbench
* Use node to run either bamazonCustomer.js or bamazonManager.js
    * i.e. type `node bamazonCustomer.js` into the root file's command line
