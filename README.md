# bamazon

## Overview

* I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL. 

* The bamazonCustomer.js file will take in orders from customers from a pre-set list of products and deplete stock from the store's inventory once a product is purchased.  

* The bamazonManager.js file allows you to View Products for Sale, View Low Inventory, Add to Inventory, and Add New Product.  

    * The Manager file will then prompt you with a series of guides, allowing you to make specifications for your actions.
